(** Notifies, if [track] is called more than n times when analyzing the same

val track_with: (int -> unit) -> unit
(** Like {!track} but takes a callback as parameter, so [track_with notify] will
  * call notify with the number of visits as argument, use

(** Print out profiling info collected by {!track_with}. *)

(** change subtask *)
 
val show_worked: int -> unit
(** show done work *)

val show_add_work: int -> unit 
(** add work to subtask *)
